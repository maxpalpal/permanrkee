This is a perl binding for Gtk-Perl 0.7000 or above. It's tested under perl 
5.005. 

We don't use the highlight function gtkextext. Instead of that, we implement
the syntax highlight in perl. The class Gtk::ExText::Highlight can do syntax
highlight. However, it supports pattern only. The syntax highlight will be 
implemented latter.


The usage of Gtk::ExText::Highlight has not been documented yet. Please refer
to samples/testhighlight. I hope I have time to write document soon.
